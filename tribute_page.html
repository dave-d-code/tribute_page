		<p>In the late 1990's, a Turkish man called Mahir Çağri created his own personal HTML page.
			That's nothing unusual, but in 1998, The Internet wasn't quite as mainstream as it is now. Using his 
			best broken English, Mr Çağri put a picture of himself, and a quote "I kiss you." Such affection, and coupled
			with his picture caused his website to go viral. </p>
		<p> Within a few days, the webpage had been visited by millions across the world, a huge number of visits
			for the time. How did things go viral before <em>"Facebook Shares", "PinIt", or "Reddit"</em> ???
			Well, by word of mouth, and of course, email. Mr. Çağri's website link was copied and forwarded to emails everywhere.</p>
		<p>Mr. Çağri found instant fame with his site, and was celebrated throughout the world. What was also interesting is that 
			other people responded, by also uploading their pictures with captions stating "I kiss you" or "I like Sex". No doubt, this lead to the birth of meme's some years later.</p>
		<p>Whether by accident, or by choice, Mr Çağri therefore prompted the one of the first social media reponses and internet craze at
			the time.</p>
